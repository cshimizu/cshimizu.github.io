I am an adventure photographer based out of Edmonton, AB.
<br><br>
Living in Edmonton the mountains were a far away dream for me as a kid, but mountain biking in the river valley kept me going outside. But, once I turned 16 and got my drivers licence the freedom of driving to the mountains took a hold of me. I've never looked back since. The high places that I would only dream of captivated me, looking up at the high peaks I never thought standing on the summit was even a possibility even in the realm of my imaginations.
<br><br> 
Inspired by the likes of Jimmy Chin, John Price, Corey Rich, I combined my passion of photography to try and share the incredible experiences I was having in the mountains. Not only to keep a record of what I did to look back on, but have visuals to my stories in hopes that it would inspire people to explore the mountains. 
<br><br>
Right now as an adventure photographer I am learning the skills to adventure, from mountain biking, hiking, to ice and alpine climbing. I think to make a great adventure photographer, you've got to be able to go on the wildest of adventures out there! 
<br><br>
I'm always looking to collaborate with other people, whether it be going on a climbing trip or producing creative content feel free to send me an email. <a href="mailto:cshimizu@ualberta.ca" style="color:lightcoral; font-family: 'Nothing You Could Do', cursive">cshimizu@ualberta.ca</a>
